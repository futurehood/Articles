# Web420 - A Private, Peer-To-Peer Internet For The People

## Introduction

With the release of DeCent-Messenger, the world's first Decentralized Web Application (DWA), Web420 is now available for experimentation as a usable prototype.

Web420 is a completely decentralized, peer-to-peer Internet that avoids all of the problems of the current Internet. There are no ads, there is no tracking, no data collection, no censorship, no surveillance, no propaganda, no external controls whatsoever. Web420 offers this experience by providing a platform where apps (DWAs) can ***scale infinitely without any cost to the developer*** because they don't require traditional hosting infrastructure. 

Because there is no cost associated with operating DWAs, there is no *justification* for engaging in the aforementioned fuckeries. Because everything happening on Web420 happens on self-signaled, encrypted, P2P channels, there is no *opportunity* for engaging in the aforementioned fuckeries.

## Overview

Web420 achieves this by relying on a software stack which provides users access through two key functionalities. Self-hosted (preferably, locally) DCNT servers offer users the ability to:

1. Host web app (DWA) source code locally, providing users complete control over the code that is executing in their browser to provide a given application experience, while also providing an SSL/TLS context which is required to gain access to some Javascript APIs, like WebRTC.
2. Receive requests from remote DWAs and proxy them to DWAs running in the DCNT server-adjacent browser. This allows users to upgrade from the WebSocket connection being managed by the DCNT server, to a WebRTC connection, managed by the browser.

Because the technology driving the experience is simple, reliant on Internet standards, and open-source, it can never be appropriated, corrupted, or compromised. It also just works with the rest of the Internet, out-of-the-box, users don't need anything extra aside from a DCNT server.

## Something Completely New

Web420 differs from existing decentralized networks, like Tor, I2P, or Freenet.

These networks 

Web420 differs from existing decentralized networks which focus on building a global network of interconnected nodes that collectively form a new Internet, like Tor, I2P, or Freenet.

These types of systems can be fantastic for anonymity, but the architecture compels your hardware to act as a routing node for other users by default. Web420 doesn't work this way. On Web420, the only connections your device will make are those that are required by a specific applications' functionality.

That being said, it is possible to build these types of networks ***on*** Web420.


To clarify further, those types of decentralized networks can be built on Web420, however, there are also other ways to utilize the platform.

## A Future So Bright, It's Blazing ðŸ”¥

Web420 fundamentally restructures the Internet to put users first and level the playing field for developers. Here, users can finally connect with one another with peace of mind, knowing that their interactions are absolutely private. Here, a mountain of venture capital is no longer a prerequisite for a successful web startup - now anyone can launch an application that serves a staggering number of users without even considering the infrastructure, let alone paying for it. This is beyond transformative - it's a complete paradigm shift.

As the ecosystem continues to grow, JavaScript libraries will emerge to provide frameworks for future-forward concepts like distributed storage and distributed computing systems, making it drop-in-simple for developers to replace dependence on traditional or cloud-based storage and computing with decentralized Web420 equivalents. There will soon be little rationale for building out new applications using traditional architecture in all but the most niche circumstance. This is the future that's coming, a DCNT Internet.

Web420 doesn't just have the potential to replace most of the existing Internet, it has the potential to burn the existing Internet to the ground.

Beware the fumes, they're toxic too.

## Conclusion

Web420 offers the promise of a pure Internet, rooted in genuine connection, that is free of interference and outside manipulation, which will always be welcome to you and those that you connect with.

The project is still in the early stages, but things are moving fast with no intention of stopping until the work is done. The world needs this.
