# Web420 - A Private, Peer-To-Peer Internet For The People

## Introduction

With the release of <a href="https://github.com/futurehood/DeCent-Messenger">DeCent Messenger</a>, the world's first Decentralized Web Application (DWA), Web420 is now available for experimentation as a usable prototype.

Web420 is a completely decentralized, peer-to-peer Internet that avoids all of the problems of the current Internet. There are no ads, there is no tracking, no data collection, no censorship, no surveillance, no propaganda, no external controls whatsoever. Web420 offers this experience by providing a platform where apps (DWAs) can ***scale infinitely without any cost to the operator*** because they don't require traditional hosting infrastructure. 

Because there are no costs associated with operating DWAs, there is no *justification* for engaging in the aforementioned fuckeries. Because everything happening on Web420 happens on self-signaled, encrypted, P2P channels, there is no *opportunity* for engaging in the aforementioned fuckeries. Web420 is 100% fuckery-free.

This is the Internet humanity deserves.

## Overview

Web420 achieves all of this by relying on a software stack which provides user access through two key functionalities. Self-hosted DCNT servers offer users the ability to:

1. Host web app (DWA) source code locally, providing users complete control over the code that is executing in their browser to provide a given application experience, while also providing an SSL/TLS context which is required to gain access to some Javascript APIs, like WebRTC.
2. Receive requests from remote DWAs and proxy them to DWAs running in the DCNT server-adjacent browser. This allows users to upgrade from the WebSocket connection being managed by the DCNT server, to a WebRTC connection, managed by the browser.

Because the technology driving the experience is simple, reliant on Internet standards, and open-source, it can never be appropriated, corrupted, or compromised.

## Something Completely New

Web420 differs from existing decentralized networks, like Freenet, I2p, or Tor.

These networks focus on building a global network of interconnected nodes which serve as an overlay to the Internet. The common emphasis of all of these projects is anonymity, and then privacy through anonymity. Though it happens a bit differently on each, essentially all of these systems achieve anonymity by passing requests through the overlay network to obfuscate the connection metadata.

Web420 works differently, almost diametrically so. Instead of consisting (primarily) of a global network, Web420 is composed of infinite, smaller, ephemeral private networks that pop in and out of existence as needed. These networks are as big as required; they can exist between two devices, or two million devices. The can grow, shrink, disappear, and re-emerge. They originate in, and are accessed solely through web browsers, over WebRTC. DCNT servers don't connect to other DCNT servers at all. They listen for requests from remote DWAs and proxy them to relevant local DWAs.

In essence, this allows DCNT server users to turn an IP address or domain name into the modern equivalent of a reachable, multipurpose ***phone number***.

DCNT users can share their address with trusted contacts they intend to connect with, and then using DWAs, the two users can directly connect with each other in their browsers, unassisted by third parties and completely privately. With the right DWA listening for requests, this system could easily act as a phone, receiving voice calls and text messages privately. And that's just the start.

There's no limit or restriction on what DWAs can do. Communications apps, social networks, microblogging, multiplayer gaming, file sharing, streaming services - all of these types of applications can easily be built on Web420 ***right now***.

Furthermore, Web420 is friendly, easy-to-use, and accessible by everyone. It just works with the rest of the Internet. Users don't need to be running a personal DCNT server to connect with someone who is. The non-user can use a DWA to connect to another user's DCNT server without running their own instance. The resulting peer-to-peer connection between browsers is a private Web420 network.

## A Future So Bright, It's Blazing ðŸ”¥

Web420 fundamentally restructures the Internet to put users first and level the playing field for developers. Here, users can finally connect with one another with peace of mind, knowing that their interactions are absolutely private. Here, a mountain of venture capital is no longer a prerequisite for a successful web startup - now anyone can launch an application that serves a staggering number of users without even considering infrastructure, let alone paying for it. This is beyond transformative - it's a complete paradigm shift.

As the ecosystem continues to grow, JavaScript libraries will emerge to provide frameworks for future-forward concepts like distributed storage and distributed computing systems, making it drop-in-simple for developers to replace dependence on traditional or cloud-based storage and computing with decentralized Web420 equivalents. There will soon be little rationale for building out new applications using traditional architecture in all but the most niche circumstance. This is the future that's coming, a DCNT Internet.

Web420 doesn't just have the potential to replace most of the existing Internet, it has the potential to burn most of the existing Internet to the ground.

Beware the fumes, they're toxic.

## Conclusion

Web420 offers the promise of a pure, modern Internet, rooted in genuine connection, that is free of interference and outside manipulation, which will always be welcome to you and those that you connect with.

The project is still in the early stages, but things are moving fast with no intention of stopping until the work is done. We need this.
